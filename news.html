            <strong>Sierra Nevada Corporation</strong> (SNC) and
            <strong>Solar Junction Corporation</strong> (Solar Junction) are
            launching a revolutionary new technology that will increase the
            efficiency of spacecraft solar array production and operation and
            lower the overall cost, providing a direct savings to customers.
            <br />
            <br />
            These advanced solar arrays are manufactured utilizing a
            patent-pending Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly method. This
            method allows each cell to be installed faster, closer together and
            more accurately than ever before.

            Saudi Arabia's prince has outlined bold plans to build a mega $2
            trillion investment fund to help wean his country off its heavy
            reliance on oil. Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who is second in line
            to the throne, outlined his plans in a five-hour interview with
            Bloomberg. "Within 20 years, we will be an economy or state that
            doesn't depend mainly on oil," he told Bloomberg.

            building 80 AN-132s – a modern version of the military transport
            plane AN-32. The new model would have modern engines and electronics
            that would make it more fuel efficient and able to take off and land
            in a range of different environments.

            Digital Globe Inc., the global leader in earth imagery and

            of a joint venture with TAQNIA, a firm dedicated to accelerating
            technology development for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in
            partnership with KACST to develop a constellation of highly capable
            small imaging satellites to support the needs of customers around
            the world. DigitalGlobe and TAQNIA and KACST signed an agreement on
            February 21, 2016, to form a joint venture that will be responsible
            for developing six or more sub-meter resolution imaging satellites.
            The small satellites are expected to be capable of collecting
            imagery with anticipated 80 cm resolution and will leverage
            DigitalGlobe’s industry-leading ground infrastructure. TAQNIA and
            KACST will benefit from DigitalGlobe’s imagery production platform
            and expertise and massive catalog of high-resolution, high-accuracy
            imagery, which will improve the native accuracy of the small
            satellite imagery. TAQNIA and KACST will also benefit from
            DigitalGlobe’s global distribution capability and existing customer
            relationships with the world’s largest buyers of commercial
            satellite imagery and geospatial information.

            Saudi Arabia has formally launched a new ICT (information,
            communication and technology) startup ventures fund worth SAR500
            million, or about US$133 million. Known as Riyadh Taqnia Capital,
            the fund was announced personally by Prince Dr. Turki bin Saud bin
            Muhammad of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology
            (KACST). Partners will include Riyadh Financial Capital and several
            other Saudi holding companies such as the General Investment Fund,
            the General Pension Fund, and the Human Resources Development Fund.
            The fund will maintain its headquarters in the Saudi capital but
            will open an international arm at 3000 Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park,
            California. Besides ICT, the fund will focus on energy,
            sustainability and advanced materials.

            Prince Turki bin Saud bin Mohammad Al Saud belongs to the family

            traditional robe and headdress of Arab men, and he has a cavernous
            office hung with portraits of three Saudi royals. When I visited him
            in Riyadh this spring, a waiter poured tea and subordinates took
            notes as Turki spoke. Everything about the man seemed to suggest
            Western notions of a complacent functionary in a complacent,
            oil-rich kingdom. But Turki doesn’t fit the stereotype, and neither
            does his country. Quietly, the prince is helping Saudi Arabia - the
            quintessential petrostate - prepare to make what could be one of the
            world’s biggest investments in solar power....
